        <p>While our Service does not require user accounts or profiles, we do use cookies and similar tracking technologies to access or store information. Specifically, we use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how our Service is being used, such as tracking the user activity on our Service and holding certain information.</p>

        <p>Analytics cookies help us understand how our visitors interact with the website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. This information is used to maintain the quality of our Service and to provide general statistics regarding the use of our website.</p>

        <p>If you prefer to avoid the use of cookies on our website, first you must disable the use of cookies in your browser and then delete the cookies saved in your browser associated with this website. You may use this option for preventing the use of cookies at any time.</p>

        <h2>4. How Do We Handle Your Social Logins?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We do not offer social logins as our Service does not require an account to use.</p>

        <h2>5. What Is Our Stance On Third-Party Websites?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our website.</p>

        <p>The Service may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services, or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Service.</p>

        <h2>6. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>

        <h2>7. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
        <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

        <p>As we do not collect any personal information for our Service, there is no risk of your personal information being exposed or compromised through our Service.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Breach</h2>
        <p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure, or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Gemini Pro Chat believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Gemini Pro Chat becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information Gemini Pro Chat will promptly investigate the matter and notify the appropriate authorities not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

        <h2>10. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>11. Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
        <p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>

        <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
